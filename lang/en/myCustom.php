The rate of progression differs between people: some people have it only in the last 5 years of their life, while others may have it for as long as 20 years. Alzheimer’s disease eventually leads to complete dependence and increasing frailty. This means a secondary illness, such as pneumonia, may eventually cause death. Other complications of Alzheimer’s disease may include: an inability to complete daily
        tasks such as planning meals and managing money a tendency to wander from home personality changes such as anxiety, depression and irritability that make relationships more difficult delusions and hallucinations in advanced stages of the disease Caring for someone with Alzheimer’s disease Caring for someone with Alzheimer’s disease can be hard — but also rewarding. Your emotional and physical support will be a great help when the person's world seems confusing and hostile.",
        'alzheimer-p3' => "How is Alzheimer's disease treated?",
        'alzheimer-p4' => "Although there is no cure, certain treatments may improve symptoms for a time. Many people with Alzheimer’s disease also learn ways to cope with their symptoms, and improve their quality of life. Medications A group of medicines called cholinergic drugs may temporarily improve cognitive symptoms of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease. These work by increasing the level of a brain chemical called acetylcholine, which helps to restore communication between brain cells. Other medications help to relieve behavioural symptoms such as sleeplessness, agitation, anxiety and depression. These treatments don’t treat Alzheimer’s disease directly but can help improve quality of life. Lifestyle change Where possible, a person with Alzheimer’s disease should try to maintain normal social contact with friends and family, exercise regularly and engage in activities that stimulate the brain. If you have any concerns about safety (for example, driving skills) see your doctor for advice.",
        'alzheimer-p5' => "How is Alzheimer’s disease diagnosed?",
        'alzheimer-p6' => "Unfortunately, there is no single test that can confirm Alzheimer’s disease. A diagnosis comes after careful assessment. This may involve: a detailed medical history a complete physical and neurological examination tests to check intellectual function a psychiatric assessment neuropsychological tests urine and blood tests medical imaging, such as an MRI scan to assess shrinking of the brain After eliminating other possible causes of symptoms (such as vascular dementia, nutritional deficiencies or depression), a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s can be made. An early diagnosis allows your doctor to work out if there is another cause of your symptoms that may be treatable. If a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is most likely, you can start to discuss medical treatment and further assistance to help slow the degenerative process.",
        'alzheimer-p7' => "Can you prevent Alzheimer’s disease?",
        'alzheimer-p8' => "There is no sure way to prevent Alzheimer’s disease. However, you can reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease by caring for your health: your heart — what’s good for your heart is good for your brain so stick to a healthy diet and don’t smoke your body — regular physical activity increases blood flow to the brain so maintain an active lifestyle your mind — an active mind helps build brain cells and strengthens their connections so socialise, do things such as puzzles and crosswords, and learn new things, such as a language. Although there is currently no known way to prevent Alzheimer's disease, there are steps you can take to potentially lower your risk of developing the disease. Some strategies include maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, getting enough sleep, staying socially active, and challenging your brain through mental activities such as reading or learning a new skill",
